#Type 3 - With parameters and return statement.

#Step 1: Definition/Declare
def sum_of_two(a, b):
    return a + b

#Step 2: Calling
result = sum_of_two(4, 5)
print(result)

# Note -
# When any function is returning any value, while calling we need to accept the returned value into a variable & then process the same.
# e.g. the returned sum we accepted in result variable and then printed the same.
