# Write a Python program to calculate the area of a triangle using the formula
# areaOfTriangle = 0.5 X base X height
# Take base = 10 and height = 5 and print the result using arithmatic operators.


base = int(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
height = int(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
area = 0.5 * (base * height)
